*   You can add up to 5 cities to the main activity. You can also remove cities from the main activity.
*   When clicking on one of the cities from the main activity, a 5 days forecast should be displayed.
*   When clicking on one of the cities from the search box dropdown, a 5 days forecast should be displayed, while having the ability to include it in the main activity if it's not already included. 
*   The main activity will have the 1st city added by default, which will be based on the GPS location. If the user doesn't give the location permissions, then the first default city will be London, UK.
*   Save the data for offline usage.
*   Extra bonus for creating a widget.
